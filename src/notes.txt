* if docker commands are really slow,

  disable IPv6 on all network connections.

* Catalog.API microservice essential dependencies:

  Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.CatalogDb database
  rabbitmq, using rabbitmq container

* create or start rabbitmq

  docker run -p 5672:5672 --name myrabbitmq rabbitmq:3-management-alpine

  docker create -p 5672:5672 --name myrabbitmq rabbitmq:3-management-alpine

* Microsoft Identity Server documentation

* docker compose network

  the service name(container name) in services of docker-compose.yml
  is also the host name in the private network created for docker compose.

  By default Compose sets up a single network for your app.
  Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network,
  and discoverable by them at a hostname identical to the container name.

  https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/

* access host network from container,

  use "host.docker.internal" host name,
  envoy proxy only runs under linux,
  we want to configure it to access web apis running in iisexpress on host.

* all environment changes to be put in launchSettings.json,
  this makes sure other development environment is not affected

* docker, execute commands in container

  docker exec -it 64c4d771a91b sh
  apk add curl
  curl -X GET "http://host.docker.internal:57424/api/v1/Catalog/items?pageSize=10" -H "accept: text/plain"

* to allow iisexpress to accept external requests

  solution:
  open ".vs\eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps\config\applicationhost.config" under soltion folder
  find site binding, for example "<binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:57424:localhost" />"
  change it to "<binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:57424:" />"
  this allows iisexpress to accept external requests

  AND START VISUAL STUDIO IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE!!!!!
