* docker compose network

  the service name(container name) in services of docker-compose.yml
  is also the host name in the private network created for docker compose.

  By default Compose sets up a single network for your app.
  Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network,
  and discoverable by them at a hostname identical to the container name.

* access host network from container,

  use "host.docker.internal" host name,
  envoy proxy only runs under linux,
  we want to configure it to access web apis running in iisexpress on host.
